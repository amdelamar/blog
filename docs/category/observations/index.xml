      <description>Web tech is so fricken exciting right now.
Offline-First Web DevelopmentSingle Page AppsResponsive Web DesignProgressive Web AppsFull Stack JavaScriptDocker ContainerizationMicroservicesServerless FaaS AppsBlockchainNone of these technologies are new in a sense. But it seems to me there&amp;#39;s lots of activity around these topics this year. You can&amp;#39;t seem to avoid a blog post or article without touching on any of these topics. And I think there is a very good reason for that.</description>

      <description>I want to start a new series where I highlight some popular websites that require JavaScript. This will be my first entry on this topic, so the formatting may change a bit in future posts. For now, I want to show off a few sites, in no particular order, that depend on JavaScript (JS) to perform their basic function: Display. I&amp;#39;m also going to include a few that do not require JS.</description>
