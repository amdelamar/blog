      <description>Its been just about four full years after graduating with a Bachelor&amp;#39;s degree in Computer Science. I graduated in Dec 2012 and started working at a Fortune 500 technology company the following month.
I&amp;#39;ve learned much in four years of college classes, but I&amp;#39;ve also learnt even more in four years of working afterwards.</description>
