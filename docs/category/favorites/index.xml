      <title>My Favorite 4 Firefox Add-ons</title>

      <description>The \&#34;mosaic killer\&#34; browser, Firefox, is my daily driver and has been for a long time. So it should be no surprise that I&#39;ve accumulated a list of favorite Firefox Add-ons (or Extensions) over the years.&amp;nbsp;
Everyone has their own favorite list, and don&#39;t think your favorite extensions aren&#39;t worthy if they aren&#39;t mentioned. But for me, personally I tend to focus on privacy and security more than your average user.</description>

      <description>Continuing from my previous list, I think I&amp;#39;ll make this a series, and post new apps I&amp;#39;m using every few months.
Sorry, its not going to contain Snapchat-like apps, photo-filters, or games. Mostly finance and security apps.
These apps are becoming daily drivers or at least seeing me use them every week. I&amp;#39;m not a hardcore iOS user, but maybe you&amp;#39;ll find something new to try out from my ever-rotating favorites list.</description>

      <title>Some of My Favorite iOS Apps</title>

      <description>No default apps.
No photo filters.
No games.
Mostly productivity and security. Which I know is boring, but these are just some of my daily apps that I use right now. And believe me, when I say that I am not a target user for mobile devices. I hardly use my smartphone let alone, make phone calls. So what I think is cool right now, might be way off base for regular smartphone users.</description>
