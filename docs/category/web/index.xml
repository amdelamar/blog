      <description>I was talking to a coworker the other day and they told me about their project they were working on. It was some legacy Java code on a Websphere cluster. Important work, but he was looking to branch out.
I told him that I was working with Kubernetes, Docker, and ICP (IBM Cloud Private) on Softlayer VMs. He was impressed but quickly asked:

\&#34;How did you get into that? How do _I_ get into that?</description>

      <description>I used Imgur to host all my images for this website, my portfolio, and a few github projects. Imgur is a (functionally speaking) small, free, image hosting site. It started as a way to share pictures on Reddit.
This blog has about 70 images hosted by Imgur. Including the different sizes for thumbnails and banners. Which is not too bad for a small site. I thought it was great. I could reduce the size of my database by only storing short URLs instead of on my own file system or full images in BLOB format.</description>
