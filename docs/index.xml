      <description>This past weekend I wanted to play around with WebSockets and learn how to setup a server and client using them. Then I though, why not try writing a server in Akka Http? Its a great opportunity for me to learn more about Akka streams, as well as a common protocol for push/pull applications on the web, like a chatroom.</description>

      <description>Maybe you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed, but its been a few months since my last blog post.
Here&amp;rsquo;s just a quick recap of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to, and what to expect from me going forward. Writing a blog has been a learning process for me and I&amp;rsquo;m adapting as I go.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing job interviews as of late and one question that keeps cropping up is about managing staff.
 What would you do if you were a technical manager? What would you do to improve your team and/or company?</description>

      <description>I was talking to a coworker the other day and they told me about their project they were working on. It was some legacy Java code on a Websphere cluster. Important work, but he was looking to branch out.</description>

      <title>My Favorite 4 Firefox Add-ons</title>

      <description>The mosaic killer browser, Firefox, is my daily driver and has been for a long time. So it should be no surprise that I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated a list of favorite Firefox Add-ons (or Extensions) over the years.
Everyone has their own favorite list, and don&amp;rsquo;t think your favorite extensions aren&amp;rsquo;t worthy if they aren&amp;rsquo;t mentioned.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a user of ProtonMail since 2015. Tomorrow marks my 3 year anniversary so to speak, of when I ditched Gmail and switched to ProtonMail.
I wrote about this last year, and my reasons for dumping Gmail haven&amp;rsquo;t changed.</description>

      <description>Maybe you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed, but its been a few months since my last blog post. The reason being two fold:
 I migrated my blog db from MySQL to Cloudant. The WYSIWYG editor on my dashboard wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready.  Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve got an alpha 1.</description>

      <guid>https://amdelamar.com/blog/java-web-frameworks-2017/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been researching Java frameworks lately, trying to find one that&amp;rsquo;s easy to extend and lightweight enough for RESTful APIs.
In my search I&amp;rsquo;ve seen all kinds of names thrown around in recent forums and old StackOverflow answers. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d compile my findings in one big list.</description>

      <title>What are Cloud-Native Applications?</title>
      <link>https://amdelamar.com/blog/what-are-cloud-native-applications/</link>

      <description>The term &amp;ldquo;Cloud Native&amp;rdquo; sounds simple enough, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading more and more posts trying to define what it actually means. Some are confused by it, or think its just marketing jargon for Cloud Foundry. What does it mean for an application to be &amp;ldquo;cloud native&amp;rdquo; in the first place?</description>

      <description>Continuing from my previous list, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll make this a series, and post new apps I&amp;rsquo;m using every few months.
Sorry, its not going to contain Snapchat-like apps, photo-filters, or games. Mostly finance and security apps.
These apps are becoming daily drivers or at least seeing me use them every week.</description>

      <title>Some Advice on Docker as a Beginner</title>
      <link>https://amdelamar.com/blog/some-advice-on-docker-as-a-beginner/</link>

      <description>Docker and containers in general are great. Containers are like mini virtual machines that run only the bare essentials of an operating system. And it accomplishes this at a fraction of the resources required than a regular virutal machine.
