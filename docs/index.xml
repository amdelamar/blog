      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing job interviews as of late and one question that keeps cropping up is about managing staff.
 What would you do if you were a technical manager? What would you do to improve your team and/or company?</description>

      <description>I was talking to a coworker the other day and they told me about their project they were working on. It was some legacy Java code on a Websphere cluster. Important work, but he was looking to branch out.
I told him that I was working with Kubernetes, Docker, and ICP (IBM Cloud Private) on Softlayer VMs.</description>

      <title>My Favorite 4 Firefox Add-ons</title>

      <description>The \&#34;mosaic killer\&#34; browser, Firefox, is my daily driver and has been for a long time. So it should be no surprise that I&#39;ve accumulated a list of favorite Firefox Add-ons (or Extensions) over the years.&amp;nbsp;
Everyone has their own favorite list, and don&#39;t think your favorite extensions aren&#39;t worthy if they aren&#39;t mentioned.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been a user of ProtonMail since 2015. Tomorrow marks my \&#34;3 year anniversary\&#34; so to speak, of when I ditched Gmail and switched to ProtonMail.
I wrote about this last year, and my reasons for dumping Gmail haven&#39;t changed.</description>

      <guid>https://amdelamar.com/blog/java-web-frameworks-2017/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been researching Java frameworks lately, trying to find one that&amp;#39;s easy to extend and lightweight enough for RESTful APIs.
In my search I&amp;#39;ve seen all kinds of names thrown around in recent forums and old StackOverflow answers. So I thought I&amp;#39;d compile my findings in one big list.</description>

      <title>What are Cloud-Native Applications?</title>
      <link>https://amdelamar.com/blog/what-are-cloud-native-applications/</link>

      <guid>https://amdelamar.com/blog/what-are-cloud-native-applications/</guid>
      <description>The term &amp;quot;Cloud Native&amp;quot; sounds simple enough, but I&amp;#39;ve been reading more and more posts trying to define what it actually means. Some are confused by it, or think its just marketing jargon for Cloud Foundry. What does it mean for an application to be &amp;quot;cloud native&amp;quot; in the first place?</description>

      <description>Continuing from my previous list, I think I&amp;#39;ll make this a series, and post new apps I&amp;#39;m using every few months.
Sorry, its not going to contain Snapchat-like apps, photo-filters, or games. Mostly finance and security apps.
These apps are becoming daily drivers or at least seeing me use them every week.</description>

      <title>Some Advice on Docker as a Beginner</title>
      <link>https://amdelamar.com/blog/some-advice-on-docker-as-a-beginner/</link>

      <description>Docker and containers in general are great. Containers are like mini virtual machines that run only the bare essentials of an operating system. And it accomplishes this at a fraction of the resources required than a regular virutal machine. This makes Docker containers ideal for many uses, such as web servers, microservices, and more.</description>

      <title>At the Office, Don&#39;t Assume Everything</title>

      <description>At the office. Its important to communicate, and assumptions are the opposite of communcation.
Assumptions lead to missed deadlines, errors, and wasted time. Someone can think that a task is being worked on since no one replied the email in the last week but is that actually true?</description>

      <description>Its 2017, and we&amp;#39;re halfway to encrypting the entire internet.
Source: https://letsencrypt.org/stats/This is huge. Our internet communications are becoming more encrypted every day using HTTPS, also known as HTTP over TLS/SSL or HTTP Secure. The free Certificate Authority, Let&amp;#39;s Encrypt, is partly responsible because of their free service.</description>
