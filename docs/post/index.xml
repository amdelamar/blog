      <description>I finished a book recently about Apache Zookeeper and was playing around with various coordination tasks (Leader Election, Locks, etc) on my own time. I like to get hands-on when learning new technologies, so this book was a decent introduction to Zookeeper.</description>

      <description>How do you start your brand new Scala projects with sbt?
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I do:
mkdir my-project &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd $_ git init echo &amp;#39;.bsp/ .idea/ target/&amp;#39; &amp;gt; .gitignore mkdir -p src/{main,test}/{scala,resources} project echo &amp;#39;sbt.version=1.6.2&amp;#39; &amp;gt; ./project/build.properties echo &amp;#39;name := &amp;#34;MyProject&amp;#34; version := &amp;#34;0.</description>

      <description>At work my team runs a large continuous integration system.
It supports running tests on pull requests, but it also allows scheduling times to run tests against a certain branches as often as users like. A form of regression testing.</description>

      <description>Last week I was mostly heads-down trying to patch a distributed service we use at work that was having problems.
Its a Scala app that uses Akka Streams to transfer large, multi-GB, files from one service to another via download and upload requests.</description>

      <description>I was migrating from PC to PC frequently, and kept re-creating my SSH and GPG keys over and over, so I had saved the commands in a little note file on my backup drive. I decided I&amp;rsquo;d just post them here so I can selfishly refer to it, but others can refer to it too.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you prefer writing Markdown instead of HTML for most things. Whether its writing a message on Slack, editing README&amp;rsquo;s on GitHub, posting Q/A&amp;rsquo;s on Stackoverflow, or most any other platform that supports Markdown. Its just plain simple and easy to use.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of building a RESTful API using Akka Http.
It was relatively easy to write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the specification of my REST API was working. And for good reason. There are plenty of examples online of how to achieve this, using Akka Testkit.</description>

      <description>This past weekend I wanted to play around with WebSockets and learn how to setup a server and client using them. Then I though, why not try writing a server in Akka Http? Its a great opportunity for me to learn more about Akka streams, as well as a common protocol for push/pull applications on the web, like a chatroom.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s just a quick recap of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to, and what to expect from me going forward. Writing a blog has been a learning process for me and I&amp;rsquo;m adapting as I go.</description>

      <description>The mosaic killer browser, Firefox, is my daily driver and has been for a long time. So it should be no surprise that I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated a list of favorite Firefox Add-ons (or Extensions) over the years.
Everyone has their own favorite list, and don&amp;rsquo;t think your favorite extensions aren&amp;rsquo;t worthy if they aren&amp;rsquo;t mentioned.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a user of ProtonMail since 2015. Tomorrow marks my 3 year anniversary so to speak, of when I ditched Gmail and switched to ProtonMail.
I wrote about this last year, and my reasons for dumping Gmail haven&amp;rsquo;t changed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been researching Java frameworks lately, trying to find one that&amp;rsquo;s easy to extend and lightweight enough for RESTful APIs.
In my search I&amp;rsquo;ve seen all kinds of names thrown around in recent forums and old StackOverflow answers. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d compile my findings in one big list.</description>

      <description>The term &amp;ldquo;Cloud Native&amp;rdquo; sounds simple enough, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading more and more posts trying to define what it actually means. Some are confused by it, or think its just marketing jargon for Cloud Foundry. What does it mean for an application to be &amp;ldquo;cloud native&amp;rdquo; in the first place?</description>

      <description>Continuing from my previous list, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll make this a series, and post new apps I&amp;rsquo;m using every few months.
Sorry, its not going to contain Snapchat-like apps, photo-filters, or games. Mostly finance and security apps.
These apps are becoming daily drivers or at least seeing me use them every week.</description>

      <guid>https://amdelamar.com/blog/some-advice-on-docker-as-a-beginner/</guid>
      <description>Docker and containers in general are great. Containers are like mini virtual machines that run only the bare essentials of an operating system. And it accomplishes this at a fraction of the resources required than a regular virutal machine. This makes Docker containers ideal for many uses, such as web servers, microservices, and more.</description>

      <description>At the office. Its important to communicate, and assumptions are the opposite of communcation.
Assumptions lead to missed deadlines, errors, and wasted time. Someone can think that a task is being worked on since no one replied the email in the last week but is that actually true?</description>

This is huge. Our internet communications are becoming more encrypted every day using HTTPS, also known as HTTP over TLS/SSL or HTTP Secure. The free Certificate Authority, Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt, is partly responsible because of their free service.</description>

      <description>A safe prediction, no?
Its not very hard to believe that all traditional Full/Mid Tower sized PCs or &amp;ldquo;desktops&amp;rdquo; will be replaced by SFF (small form factor) or Mini Tower PCs sooner or later. These SFF computers are the size of a loaf of bread or a shoebox; instead of the cabient sized monsters that people have today.</description>

      <description>What happened?
I signed up for ProtonMail in 2015 and ditched Gmail. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it ever since.
Why did you do that?
Mainly because of better privacy, but it has the added benefit of being highly secure.
1) Gmail is not secure in transit.</description>

      <description>Some video games are good. And some suck.
Maybe they could&amp;rsquo;ve been great and a lot of fun to play. Or maybe they already are fun to play, but are just poisoned with bad decisions from developers or publishers. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot going on and its hard to pinpoint a single area that plagues the gaming industry by itself.</description>

There are lots of online ads. And there are some that are&amp;hellip; acceptable. Then there are the worst of offenders. The kind that sends people into fits, immediately closing the page, and leaving the website forever.</description>

      <description>Its been just about four full years after graduating with a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. I graduated in Dec 2012 and started working at a Fortune 500 technology company the following month.
I&amp;rsquo;ve learned much in four years of college classes, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also learnt even more in four years of working afterwards.</description>

      <description>I think this is an old IT Department prank, but still a fun trick to play on your coworkers at the office, once in a long while. While our office policy is to lock your computer physically, and by using Windows lock (Or sleep mode) when you step away from your desk, not all of our coworkers remember to do so, everytime.</description>
