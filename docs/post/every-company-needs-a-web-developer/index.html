      <h2>Every Company needs a Web Developer</h2>
      <p>
        <p>Even if you got a website for free, and maintain it yourself, you have to admit...</p><p>You could use a <strong>web developer</strong>.</p><p>Someone to handle all the technical aspects of building, hosting, securing, designing, and maintaining your website for you or your company. A blend of SysAdmin, WebDev, WebDesigner, and Technical Support all rolled into one. If you&#39;re a small company or start-up, that is. Large companies will obviously need more folks for each department, as their needs will be much greater. But I&#39;ll focus on small companies and hobbyists who currently don&#39;t have a dedicated web developer.</p><p>My father runs a small company. He repairs spas, pools, hot tubs, and more for a living. He started in 1991 and operated for 20 years without a website. After all, he does everything himself! His business saw an increase in customers calling him for help from all over Michigan, and other states, <strong>after </strong>he got his website at <a href=\"http://www.spatecservice.com/\">SpaTecService.com</a>. It gave him immediate visibility online. His customer calls increased especially after 2008&#39;s recession. My father was working 12 hour days just about everyday to fit every caller in his schedule. He told me, &quot;I had no idea if this would work&quot;. It helped him tremendously with getting his name out there. His business started getting online reviews too; further cementing his profile in Google&#39;s search results.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Search Results Help Businesses</h2><p>Why all the <strong>rage </strong>over a simple website? His business model hasn&#39;t changed in years, so what gives?</p><p>Simply put, the market has shifted. People search online for answers more than ever. Wanna find a bike shop? Search online. Wanna find reviews on a restaurant? Search online. Wanna find tickets for a movie? Search online.</p><p>People don&#39;t thumb through a copy of YellowPages anymore. Young adults (myself included!) especially don&#39;t do this. We are quick to open a web browser and search the internet instead, for... well... anything!</p><p>So naturally, businesses have to follow suit. Businesses today need websites for their name to be noticed. Its the internet equivalent of a phone book. And its a new market shift that won&#39;t be going away, anytime soon. Starting a new business in 2017? You should get a website (at least a domain name) right away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Start Building a Website</h2><p><em>&quot;But building websites is hard though!&quot;</em></p><p>Its actually gotten a lot easier. There are many companies built on the idea of building websites for other companies. As crazy as that sounds. (Wix, <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">Wordpress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/\">Squarespace</a> for starters). My father used a service from <a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/\">BlueHost</a> to buy his domain and build his website from a template. He could pick the colors, layout, and start typing content and immediately see the published results. He didn&#39;t purchase a server, configure the network, route his domain to his IP, setup a firewall, install Apache on Unix, or code a single HTML document at all.</p><p>He didn&#39;t <strong>need </strong>a web developer. Or sysadmin, or anyone for that matter.</p><p>He <strong>was </strong>the web developer.</p><p>With the service he used, he could create his website in minutes, and keep updating it for years. He didn&#39;t need to hire anybody. He just needed a website for his business.</p><p>So, even if you already have a website. Or if you are in need of one for your hobby or business. I encourage you to explore your options by... of all things... searching online! There are dozens if not hundreds of services out there, ready to help build you a website. Seems most have a free plan to start with and they&#39;re designed to grow as your company grows. Making it simple to start and expand later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Learn the way of Web-Dev</h2><p>And for those of us who are ready for a challenge; you can <strong>learn</strong> web development<strong> online</strong>,<strong> for free</strong>. The are many sites you can learn how to code from, such as <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\">w3schools</a>, <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\">codeacademy</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/courses/development/web-development/\">udemy</a>. You could learn HTML and CSS to make basic web pages, and host them on a site like <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a>.</p><p>I wrote my personal site <a href=\"http://amdelamar.com/\">amdelamar.com</a> in this way. I used a few CSS libraries (w3css, icomoon) and wrote a single page of HTML, and placed it all on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub</a>. Then linked&nbsp;https://amdelamar.github.io/portfolio/ to http://amdelamar.com/ using a CNAME file. (GitHub has really outdone themselves here. <em>Bravo </em>for such a great service!)</p><p>Why not <strong>become your own Web Developer</strong>?</p><p>I mean seriously. You can do it! I just explained what my father did for his business and what I did for myself. You can follow along or carve your own path, and you can start today.</p><p>Stop reading this. Start with a free site, and start learning to code in HTML/CSS. Before you know it, you&#39;ll have a second hobby in building websites and a new title: Web Developer.</p>
