      <description>Back in 2014 I decided to start blogging. (Cue sad trumpet horn.) Well... I tried to.
Turns out, blogging is like a second job. Always second-shift work, after my day job. Long hours with no OT or health benefits. But hey! I get to gloat that I have my own blog right? Back then, I simply ran into other life events that held up my blog for a period of time.</description>

      <description>I think this is an old IT Department prank, but still a fun trick to play on your coworkers at the office, once in a long while. While our office policy is to lock your computer physically, and by using Windows lock (Or sleep mode) when you step away from your desk, not all of our coworkers remember to do so, everytime.
Let this be their friendly--and annoying--reminder to always secure your workstation!</description>
