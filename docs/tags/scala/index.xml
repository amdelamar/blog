      <description>How do you start your brand new Scala projects with sbt?
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I do:
mkdir my-project &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd $_ git init echo &amp;#39;.bsp/ .idea/ target/&amp;#39; &amp;gt; .gitignore mkdir -p src/{main,test}/{scala,resources} project echo &amp;#39;sbt.version=1.6.2&amp;#39; &amp;gt; ./project/build.properties echo &amp;#39;name := &amp;#34;MyProject&amp;#34; version := &amp;#34;0.</description>

      <description>At work my team runs a large continuous integration system.
It supports running tests on pull requests, but it also allows scheduling times to run tests against a certain branches as often as users like. A form of regression testing.</description>

      <description>Last week I was mostly heads-down trying to patch a distributed service we use at work that was having problems.
Its a Scala app that uses Akka Streams to transfer large, multi-GB, files from one service to another via download and upload requests.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ll here&amp;rsquo;s a quick guide on how to continuously run sbt test on every pull request, and after merging deploy it to Heroku. And we&amp;rsquo; do this all within the comfort of GitHub, using their automation tool called GitHub Actions.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of building a RESTful API using Akka Http.
It was relatively easy to write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the specification of my REST API was working. And for good reason. There are plenty of examples online of how to achieve this, using Akka Testkit.</description>

      <description>This past weekend I wanted to play around with WebSockets and learn how to setup a server and client using them. Then I though, why not try writing a server in Akka Http? Its a great opportunity for me to learn more about Akka streams, as well as a common protocol for push/pull applications on the web, like a chatroom.</description>
