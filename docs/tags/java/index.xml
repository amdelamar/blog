      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been researching Java frameworks lately, trying to find one that&amp;#39;s easy to extend and lightweight enough for RESTful APIs.
In my search I&amp;#39;ve seen all kinds of names thrown around in recent forums and old StackOverflow answers. So I thought I&amp;#39;d compile my findings in one big list.
The tech/features are taken right off the websites for the framework and some from their documentation, if it was easy to read through.</description>

      <description>Are you developing a Java AWT/Swing application?
Is your target audience--or entire company--using Windows?
Well, you&amp;#39;re not alone. There are a lot of Java developers who end up writing applications for their Windows coworkers (ahem, like me!). Its strange to be programming in a language meant to be run on all operating systems, yet somehow, gets only used on one OS.
&amp;nbsp;
So what&amp;#39;s the problem then?There isn&amp;#39;t a problem, per se.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ll save the obvious &amp;quot;must-have&amp;quot; features for Java EE webapps, for later. This post will focus on the smaller details of Java EE programming, and what useful methods might save you time and possibly increase site traffic. If you&amp;#39;ve already started building your site, or you&amp;#39;re maintaining an old behemoth, then these tips should help tremendously.

      <description>Java is a nice programming language. But Java/J2EE websites can grow to be very complex in a short amount of time. One of the biggest areas of discussion about J2EE development today is about the many kinds of frameworks that can be implemented with your project, and what valuable features they provide, or amount of work they chop down.
The below graph is how I feel about the amount of effort required to learn, build, and test, with 2 popular J2EE frameworks.</description>
