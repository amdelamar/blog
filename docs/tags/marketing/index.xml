      <description>A safe prediction, no?
Its not very hard to believe that all traditional Full/Mid Tower sized PCs or &amp;quot;desktops&amp;quot; will be replaced by SFF (small form factor) or Mini Tower PCs sooner or later. These SFF computers are the size of a loaf of bread or a shoebox; instead of the cabient sized monsters that people have today.</description>

      <description>Some video games are good. And some suck.
Maybe they could&amp;#39;ve been great and a lot of fun to play. Or maybe they already are fun to play, but are just poisoned with bad decisions from developers or publishers. There&amp;#39;s a lot going on and its hard to pinpoint a single area that plagues the gaming industry by itself.</description>

      <description>Even if you got a website for free, and maintain it yourself, you have to admit...
You could use a web developer.
Someone to handle all the technical aspects of building, hosting, securing, designing, and maintaining your website for you or your company.</description>
