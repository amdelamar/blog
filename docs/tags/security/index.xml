      <description>I finished a book recently about Apache Zookeeper and was playing around with various coordination tasks (Leader Election, Locks, etc) on my own time. I like to get hands-on when learning new technologies, so this book was a decent introduction to Zookeeper.</description>

      <description>The mosaic killer browser, Firefox, is my daily driver and has been for a long time. So it should be no surprise that I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated a list of favorite Firefox Add-ons (or Extensions) over the years.
Everyone has their own favorite list, and don&amp;rsquo;t think your favorite extensions aren&amp;rsquo;t worthy if they aren&amp;rsquo;t mentioned.</description>

      <description>Its 2017, and we&amp;rsquo;re halfway to encrypting the entire internet.
Source: https://letsencrypt.org/stats/
This is huge. Our internet communications are becoming more encrypted every day using HTTPS, also known as HTTP over TLS/SSL or HTTP Secure. The free Certificate Authority, Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt, is partly responsible because of their free service.</description>

      <description>What happened?
I signed up for ProtonMail in 2015 and ditched Gmail. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it ever since.
Why did you do that?
Mainly because of better privacy, but it has the added benefit of being highly secure.
1) Gmail is not secure in transit.</description>

      <description>People hate online advertisements&amp;hellip; Let me repeat that.
People really HATE online ads.
There are lots of online ads. And there are some that are&amp;hellip; acceptable. Then there are the worst of offenders. The kind that sends people into fits, immediately closing the page, and leaving the website forever.</description>

      <description>There were some big data leaks in 2016 that revealed millions of passwords and credentials online. LinkedIn for example had over 160 million credentials stolen from its database. If you had an account on LinkedIn before 2012, there is a near 100% probability that your email + password have been decoded, or &amp;ldquo;cracked&amp;rdquo;, already.</description>
