      <description>The mosaic killer browser, Firefox, is my daily driver and has been for a long time. So it should be no surprise that I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated a list of favorite Firefox Add-ons (or Extensions) over the years.
Everyone has their own favorite list, and don&amp;rsquo;t think your favorite extensions aren&amp;rsquo;t worthy if they aren&amp;rsquo;t mentioned.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a user of ProtonMail since 2015. Tomorrow marks my 3 year anniversary so to speak, of when I ditched Gmail and switched to ProtonMail.
I wrote about this last year, and my reasons for dumping Gmail haven&amp;rsquo;t changed.</description>

      <description>What happened?
I signed up for ProtonMail in 2015 and ditched Gmail. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it ever since.
Why did you do that?
Mainly because of better privacy, but it has the added benefit of being highly secure.
1) Gmail is not secure in transit.</description>
