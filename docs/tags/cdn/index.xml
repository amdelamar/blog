      <description>I used Imgur to host all my images for this website, my portfolio, and a few github projects. Imgur is a (functionally speaking) small, free, image hosting site. It started as a way to share pictures on Reddit.
This blog has about 70 images hosted by Imgur. Including the different sizes for thumbnails and banners. Which is not too bad for a small site. I thought it was great. I could reduce the size of my database by only storing short URLs instead of on my own file system or full images in BLOB format.</description>
