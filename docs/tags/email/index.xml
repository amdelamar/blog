      <description>I&#39;ve been a user of ProtonMail since 2015. Tomorrow marks my \&#34;3 year anniversary\&#34; so to speak, of when I ditched Gmail and switched to ProtonMail.
I wrote about this last year, and my reasons for dumping Gmail haven&#39;t changed.
If you&#39;re interested in taking back your email privacy, I encourage you to give ProtonMail (PM) a try. Its free to try and has more to offer now than before when I signed up.</description>

      <title>2 Years Without Gmail</title>

      <description>What happened?
I signed up for ProtonMail in 2015 and ditched Gmail. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it ever since.
Why did you do that?
Mainly because of better privacy, but it has the added benefit of being highly secure.
1) Gmail is not secure in transit. Which means, when the emails are being transported from server-to-server. ProtonMail offers end-to-end encryption using OpenPGP and symmetric encryption to non-PM users.
2) Gmail is not secure at rest.</description>
