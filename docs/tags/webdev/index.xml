      <description>Web tech is so fricken exciting right now.
Offline-First Web DevelopmentSingle Page AppsResponsive Web DesignProgressive Web AppsFull Stack JavaScriptDocker ContainerizationMicroservicesServerless FaaS AppsBlockchainNone of these technologies are new in a sense. But it seems to me there&amp;#39;s lots of activity around these topics this year. You can&amp;#39;t seem to avoid a blog post or article without touching on any of these topics. And I think there is a very good reason for that.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Violate Imgur&#39;s Terms of Service by using it as a CDN</title>

      <description>I used Imgur to host all my images for this website, my portfolio, and a few github projects. Imgur is a (functionally speaking) small, free, image hosting site. It started as a way to share pictures on Reddit.
This blog has about 70 images hosted by Imgur. Including the different sizes for thumbnails and banners. Which is not too bad for a small site. I thought it was great. I could reduce the size of my database by only storing short URLs instead of on my own file system or full images in BLOB format.</description>

      <title>JavaScript Dependent Websites</title>

      <description>I want to start a new series where I highlight some popular websites that require JavaScript. This will be my first entry on this topic, so the formatting may change a bit in future posts. For now, I want to show off a few sites, in no particular order, that depend on JavaScript (JS) to perform their basic function: Display. I&amp;#39;m also going to include a few that do not require JS.</description>

      <title>Every Company needs a Web Developer</title>

      <description>Even if you got a website for free, and maintain it yourself, you have to admit...
You could use a web developer.
Someone to handle all the technical aspects of building, hosting, securing, designing, and maintaining your website for you or your company. A blend of SysAdmin, WebDev, WebDesigner, and Technical Support all rolled into one. If you&amp;#39;re a small company or start-up, that is. Large companies will obviously need more folks for each department, as their needs will be much greater.</description>

      <description>Back in 2014 I decided to start blogging. (Cue sad trumpet horn.) Well... I tried to.
Turns out, blogging is like a second job. Always second-shift work, after my day job. Long hours with no OT or health benefits. But hey! I get to gloat that I have my own blog right? Back then, I simply ran into other life events that held up my blog for a period of time.</description>
