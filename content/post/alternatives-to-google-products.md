The anti-Google crowd is growing.

A blog post from [restoreprivacy.com](https://restoreprivacy.com/google-alternatives/) recently covered a few Google Products that could be replaced with some alternative products. The idea is that, these alternatives will respect your privacy and data, or don't track your online activity.  

I want to expand on their list with some suggestions of my own. And include things that were not mentioned.  

**I'll start by reiterating the common services:**

- Google Search <-- DuckDuckGo, StartPage  
- Chrome <-- Firefox, Tor, Brave, or any Firefox-based browser (e.g. Palemoon, Iceweasel, WaterFox)
- Gmail <-- ProtonMail, Mailfence, Tutanota
- Google Calendar <-- Etar  
- Google Drive <-- TeamDrive
- Google Docs <-- LibreOffice  
- Google Photos <-- Shoebox, Piwigo  
- Google Maps <--  OpenStreetMaps, MapHub, Maps.me
- Hangouts <-- [Wire](https://wire.com/en/), Telegram, Keybase, or Signal
- Google Plus <-- Does anyone even use this? Mastodon, Diaspora  
- YouTube <-- [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en/home/), Vimeo
- ChromeOS <-- Linux  
- Google Fonts <-- FontSquirrel  
- Google Forms <-- JotForm  
- Google Surveys <-- SurveyMonkey  
- Google Translate <-- DeepL
- Android <-- iPhone is the only reasonable choice, but you can checkout how to [secure your Android device](https://restoreprivacy.com/secure-android-device/) instead of switching.  


**Now for more alternatives:**

- Google Authenticator <-- [Authy](https://authy.com/), [Authenticator](https://mattrubin.me/authenticator/)
- Google Graphs <-- [Plotly](https://plot.ly/)? Not entirely sure if they have a HTTP API.  
- reCAPTCHA <-- No real suggestion. Webdevs might be able to program some custom captcha instead, which I know... sucks.  
- Google Fiber <-- No real suggestion. But I do recommend using a good VPN service regardless of your ISP you're stuck with.  
- Google Fi <-- No real suggestion. Since this really depends on your location and available options.
- DNS (8.8.8.8) <-- [Quad9](https://quad9.net) (9.9.9.9) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)  
- Google Domains <-- [PorkBun](https://porkbun.com/), Namecheap
- Google Analytics <-- Matomo (formerly Piwik)  
- GCP <-- AWS, IBM Cloud, Pivotal, OpenShift, or others mentioned [here](https://www.ramblingware.com/blog/learn-to-code-cloud-native-apps-for-free).  
- GKS <-- AWS EKS, IBM Container Service, RedHat OpenShift, Pivotal, Azure, or others mentioned [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/#hosted-solutions).  

My list is terribly incomplete. I also haven't tested most of the apps, social media, calendar, drive, solutions. Because I don't use them in the first place. So take my suggestions with a grain of salt.  

I'm not as anti-Google as some others might be. I still use Google Domains, and plan to stop using Google Maps on my iPhone. But I did migrate [to ProtonMail from Gmail](https://www.ramblingware.com/blog/2-years-without-gmail), and that was my biggest challenge 3 years ago so I got that going for me. Which is nice.
