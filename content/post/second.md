Its been quite a while, since I started my website, and now I'm getting back into things. I've got lots to share, and will be posting more to my other pages.  

I've added 2 Projects to my Past Projects page. Senior Project and Bookmarks for Bluemix. These pages describe the overall work and results of the project. Their code won't be available for download in the Code page, but I will be adding other items for others to download later.  

For now, I won't be sharing a lot of info on my Blog, but I will be sharing more Code and Projects soon. So keep an eye out for those updates.  

Thanks to my family and friends for their support! Thanks to everyone else for looking!
