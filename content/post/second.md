<p>Its been quite a while, since I started my website, and now I&#39;m getting back into things. I&#39;ve got lots to share, and will be posting more to my other pages.<br /><br />I&#39;ve added 2 Projects to my Past Projects page. Senior Project and Bookmarks for Bluemix. These pages describe the overall work and results of the project. Their code won&#39;t be available for download in the Code page, but I will be adding other items for others to download later.<br /><br />For now, I won&#39;t be sharing a lot of info on my Blog, but I will be sharing more Code and Projects soon. So keep an eye out for those updates.<br /><br />Thanks to my family and friends for their support! Thanks to everyone else for looking!<br />&nbsp;</p>
