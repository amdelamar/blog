This post marks when I started building my first blog on Wix, a website-generating factory.  

Ever since I started my blog on their site, I kept getting a nagging feeling, that I wasn't doing it right... I wasn't programming... I was cheating. It felt wrong. I vowed that I would return to program my own website.  

"What kind of programmer doesn't create their own website?", I thought.

```java
if("Programmer".equals(user.getRole()) ) {
    return user.createHTMLWebsite();
} else {
    return user.purchaseHTMLWebsite();
}
```

I'll be adding more content soon! Stay tuned!
