<p>This post marks when I started building my first blog on Wix, a website-generating factory.<br /><br />Ever since I started my blog on their site, I kept getting a nagging feeling, that I wasn&#39;t doing it right... I wasn&#39;t programming... I was cheating. It felt wrong. I vowed that I would return to program my own website.<br /><br />&quot;What kind of programmer doesn&#39;t create their own website?&quot;, I thought.</p><pre><code class=\"language-java\">if(\"Programmer\".equals(user.getRole()) ){<br/>    return user.createHTMLWebsite();<br/>}<br/>else{<br/>    return user.purchaseHTMLWebsite();<br/>}</code></pre><p>I&#39;ll be adding more content soon! Stay tuned!</p>
