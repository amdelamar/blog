<div>I've been a user of ProtonMail since 2015. Tomorrow marks my \"3 year anniversary\" so to speak, of when I ditched Gmail and switched to ProtonMail.</div><div><br></div><div>I <a href=\"https://www.ramblingware.com/blog/2-years-without-gmail\">wrote about this last year</a>, and my reasons for dumping Gmail haven't changed.</div><div><br></div><div>If you're interested in taking back your email privacy, I encourage you to give <a href=\"https://protonmail.com/\">ProtonMail</a> (PM) a try. Its free to try and has more to offer now than before when I signed up. But today I wanted to highlight the custom themes I've been diligently working on.</div><div><br></div><div>The web app for PM is simple and clean. But for some users like myself, we wanted a little bit more customization than initially offered.</div><div><br></div><div>Thus, I created the \"<a href=\"https://austindelamar.com/pm-theme/\">pm-theme</a>\" project and have tried a hand at tweaking the colors of the web app. Now PM users can download/copy and override the default colors of their inbox. All for free, and easy to extend. If you're a PM user, you can try out a new theme in seconds!</div><div><br></div><div>I built 3 main themes, Dark, Flat, and GM (like Gmail but not exactly).</div><div><br></div><div>Today I'm uploading a background image theme, where the Swiss Mountains are behind the inbox. Its pretty fancy if I might say so myself.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://cdn.ramblingware.com/file/ramblingware/2018/pm-background.png\"></div><div><br></div><div><div class=\"language-css highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c\">/* Copy this line into ProtonMail's custom theme box: */</span>\n<span class=\"k\">@import</span> <span class=\"sx\">url(\"https://austindelamar.com/pm-theme/themes/bg-image-theme.min.css\")</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div></div></div><div>Its actually more difficult than I thought to override the CSS styling and default colors of a website, especially one that continuously updates every week. But its been fun to tweak and try out fun CSS tricks and grow my skills in front-end development as well. Since I mostly program in back-end services for my day job.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, if you're a PM user I hope you enjoy the themes, and if you're not a PM user, sign up today for free. Give it a shot like I did.<br></div>
