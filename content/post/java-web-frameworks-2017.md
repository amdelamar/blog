<p>I&#39;ve been researching Java frameworks lately, trying to find one that&#39;s easy to extend and lightweight enough for RESTful APIs.</p><p>In my search I&#39;ve seen all kinds of names thrown around in recent forums and old StackOverflow answers. So I thought I&#39;d compile my findings in one big list.</p><p>The tech/features are taken right off the websites for the framework and some from their documentation, if it was easy to read through. I also put down things that stand out from the crowd, such as Jodd having Email support. And not listing common things like HTTPS. I also put in my general feelings a bit too, so be warned. This isn&#39;t an unbiased list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://actframework.org/\">ACT Framework</a> - v1.4.9 released 20 August 2017<br />MVC. DI. Websocket. Annotations. Maven.<br />Sponsored by ThinkingStudio and possibly JetBrains.<br />Created by a guy after Play 2.x released and left a bad taste in his mouth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://struts.apache.org/\">Apache Struts</a> - v2.5.14.1 released 30 November 2017<br />MVC. XML, JSP, JSTL. Plugins needed to support REST, AJAX, JSON, and FreeMarker.<br />Struts 1 was so bad that they merged with WebWork 2 to make Struts 2. Roughly after 2006.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://tapestry.apache.org/\">Apache Tapestry</a> - v5.4.3 was released 24 April 2017<br />Groovy. Scala. CoC. TDD. DI. Jetty (embed), jQuery. AJAX. Maven or Gradle.<br />Unique template &quot;.tml&quot; extension. Hot dev reloading. Component oriented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://wicket.apache.org/\">Apache Wicket</a> - v8.0.0-M8 released 25 October 2017<br />Just Java and HTML. log4j. AJAX. CDI. Component oriented.<br />An Apache project since 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dropwizard.io/\">Dropwizard Framework</a> - v1.2.2 released 27 November 2017<br />Jetty (embedded), Jersey (JAX-RS), Jackson (JSON), Metrics. Maven. HTTP/2. Freemarker/Mustache.<br />Sponsored by JetBrains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://jodd.org/\">Jodd Framework</a> - v3.9.1 released 10 September 2017<br />Micro. IoC. MVC. JSON. Email. Gradle. Many plugins available.<br />New kid on the block.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://jooby.org/\">Jooby Framework</a> - v1.2.3 released 13 November 2017<br />Kotlin. MVC. No XML. WebSockets. HTTP/2.

JSON, JPA, REST. XML. WebSockets. Embed server container or create WAR.

Akka/Netty.<br />Builds with sbt, the &quot;maven killer&quot;.<br />Play started as an internal project at Zenexity in 2007 and open-sourced in 2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://sparkjava.com/\">Spark Framework</a> - v2.7.1 released 14 November 2017<br />Micro. Jetty (embedded), Kotlin, Maven or Gradle. No HTTP/2 support.<br />Seem great but development is really slow for new features.<br />Not to be confused with Apache Spark the cluster engine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/\">Spring MVC Framework</a> - v5.0.2 released 27 November 2017<br />MVC. Maven. XML. CoC. IoC. Annotations. The Spring ecosystem is huge.<br />Anti-J2EE solution. Calls itself &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; but frankly can be overwhelming.<br />Arguably the most popular Java framework for the last 10+ years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://stripesframework.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/STRIPES/overview\">Stripes Framework</a> - v1.6.0 released 23 July 2015<br />CoC. Servlet. JSP. A dead framework? &ldquo;Web Sites Built With Stripes&rdquo; list is shrinking.<br />Created by one guy&rsquo;s frustration with Apache Struts, Tapestry, and Wicket.<br />Unsure what the relationship with Atlassian is as this point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/yegor256/takes\">Takes Framework</a> - v1.7.1 released 14 October 2017<br />True object-oriented?

CoC. ORM. Gradle. Built on top of Spring Boot. Many plugins available.<br />GSP grails server pages.<br />Compared to Play Framework quite a bit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/google/guice\">Guice Framework</a> - v4.1 released 17 July 2016<br />AOP, DI, Annotations.<br />Created by Google initailly for Google AdWords.<br />Compatible with Google App Engine and oddly enough it has a Struts 2 plugin?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.web4j.com/\">WEB4J Framework</a> - v4.9.0 released unknown<br />Dead? References Java 1.5 and JSP 2.0 still.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: I intentionally left out some like JSF or JAX-RS. Because those are standards, not frameworks. And I&rsquo;m human so there is probably a lot more that I haven&rsquo;t heard of or missed.</p><p>If none of the above works for you; you can do what <a href=\"http://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/22/takes-java-web-framework.html\">this guy did</a> and create your own Java servlet container and framework... from scratch!</p>
